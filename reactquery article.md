             #TanStack Query v3

Asynchronous state management made easy for TS/JS, React, Solid, Vue, and Svelte.

Throw away your granular state management, manual refetting, and unending bowls of async-spaghetti code. TanStack Query provides declarative, always-updated auto-managed queries and changes that improve both the developer and user experiences.


###FAMILIAR & SIMPLE

You already know how to utilise TanStack Query if you've worked with promises or async/await. There are no global states to maintain, reducers, normalisation systems, or complex setups to comprehend. Simply send your data to a function that resolves it (or throws an error), and the rest is history.


###AUTOMATIC & DECLARATIVE

The days of manually writing data retrieval logic are past. Tell TanStack Query where to acquire your data and how fresh it has to be, and the rest will take care of itself. With no setup, it manages caching, background updates, and stale data right out of the box.

###EXTENSIBLE

TanStack Query may be configured down to the observer instance of a query, with knobs and settings to meet any use-case. It includes devtools, infinite-loading APIs, and first-rate mutation tools to make changing your data a joy. But don't worry, everything is set up for success!


##There are no dependencies. Each of the feature.

TanStack Query, with no dependencies, is exceptionally light for the functionality set it delivers. TanStack Query is the battle-tested solution to enable you achieve at the speed of your imagination, from weekend hobbies to business e-commerce systems (yes, I'm looking at you, Walmart!).

##Fewer edge cases, less code.
Instead of writing reducers, cache logic, timers, retry logic, sophisticated async/await scripting (and so on...), you write a tiny fraction of the code you would typically write. When you utilise TanStack Query, you'll be astonished by how little code you write or how much code you delete.
